## Video Creation Guidelines

### Production Tips
1. **Framing**: Keep hands and upper body centered in frame
2. **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting to show hand shapes clearly
3. **Background**: Use a plain, contrasting background (light or dark depending on lighting)
4. **Attire**: Wear solid-colored clothing that contrasts with the background
5. **Pacing**: Sign at natural conversational speed for each video type
6. **Multiple takes**: Record 2-3 takes per video for quality selection

### Quality Assurance
- Verify video plays correctly on target devices (iOS, Android)
- Check for audio sync issues
- Ensure proper file naming before uploading
- Validate file size is within target range

## Storage and Organization

- Store original high-quality source files separately from compressed versions
- Use a consistent backup strategy for all video assets
- Version control: Use date prefixes for iterations (e.g., `WATER_v2.mp4`)
- Metadata: Consider embedding chapter information in video files where applicable

## Integration Notes

Videos are referenced in the app's content database by filename (without extension).
Ensure filenames exactly match database entries for proper asset linking.
